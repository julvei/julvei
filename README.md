## My quirks
* Since 2015 I have changed my keyboard layout to the German [neo-layout](https://www.neo-layout.org/), which I extremly appreciate as programmer. It's natively available for linux!
* Mainly I work on my private [gitea server](https://gitea.io/en-us/), therefore github is not as frequently used by me.
